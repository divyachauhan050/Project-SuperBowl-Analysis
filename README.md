# Project - SuperBowl Analysis

This project analyzes the evolution of viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018 (**until SuperBowl LII**).

## About the Datasets
About the datasets:
I have used three different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘super_bowls.csv’** contains the details about the game data such as the date, SuperBowl #, venue details, live attendance, and the winning and losing team details.

2. **‘tv.csv’** contains broadcasting-related data such as the SuperBowl #, the network covering the game, the advertisement cost for a 30-second spot, and viewership details (average and total viewers as well as the rating shares). 

3. **‘halftime_musicians.csv’** contains information about the halftime shows, such as the SuperBowl #, the performer’s name, and the # of songs that they performed.
